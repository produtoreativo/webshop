# SYNC

Use this skill to make the repository internally consistent with the current
ProdOps context or to synchronize a work branch with its intended base.

The Sync phase has two independent steps, each guaranteeing a distinct integrity:

- **`rebase` — integridade do repositório git** (pronto para merge, base incorporada, testes preservados)
- **`align` — integridade dos artefatos ProdOps** (BDD, Event Storming, arquitetura, OBC e Release Trail refletem o diff do branch)

Os steps são complementares: nenhum substitui o outro. O Sync **não** abre PR
(Finish), **não** roda a pipeline completa (Ship) e **não** reescreve decisões
de produto upstream. Quando invocado com um argumento de step (`/sync <step>`),
execute apenas aquele step. Caso contrário, execute ambos em sequência.

## Required input context

Before starting, the agent must have:

- `work-item-id` — the GitHub issue number of the Feature
- `iteration-id` — the Iteration Plan identifier
- `actor.player` — the current player (`claude`, `codex`, or `copilot`)
- `correlation-id` — the Delivery-flow UUID provided by the chain runner. If
  invoked standalone, generate a new UUID.

## Preconditions

1. `prodops/skills/prodops-emit-event/SKILL.md` has been read.
2. The tool is available at `prodops/runtime/tools/emit-event/scripts/emit-event`.

## Phase: Sync.Started

**Moment**: after input context is verified, before any Sync work begins.

Emit:

```json
{
  "event": "Delivery.Sync.Started",
  "work-item-id": "<work-item-id>",
  "iteration-id": "<iteration-id>",
  "correlation-id": "<correlation-id>",
  "execution-id": "<new-uuid>",
  "actor": { "player": "<player>", "agent": "sync-agent" },
  "payload": {}
}
```

If the tool returns `status: error`: report the error, fix the input, do not proceed.

## Steps

| Step | File | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `rebase` | [steps/rebase/SKILL.md](steps/rebase/SKILL.md) | Branch is behind origin, has conflicts, or needs to incorporate upstream changes |
| `align` | [steps/align/SKILL.md](steps/align/SKILL.md) | BDD Features, Event Storming, architecture, or Release Trail are stale relative to what was implemented |

If the requested step is not listed, run the full flow.

## Inputs

- `AGENTS.md`
- `prodops/artifacts/product/`
- `prodops/framework/journeys/assessment/`
- `prodops/artifacts/trails/sessions/` (active session trail)

## Flow

When invoked without a step argument, execute both steps in sequence:

1. **[rebase](steps/rebase/SKILL.md)** — fetch remote updates, fast-forward base, integrate into feature branch, resolve conflicts, preserve TDD, validate
2. **[align](steps/align/SKILL.md)** — identify stale artifacts, trace source of truth in `prodops/`, update only impacted files, record in Release Trail

For detailed branch synchronization mechanics, read `references/workflow.md`.

## Phase: Sync.Completed

**Moment**: after both steps (rebase and align) succeed — before reporting success to the caller.

Emit using the **same `correlation-id`** as Sync.Started:

```json
{
  "event": "Delivery.Sync.Completed",
  "work-item-id": "<work-item-id>",
  "iteration-id": "<iteration-id>",
  "correlation-id": "<same-uuid-as-started>",
  "execution-id": "<new-uuid>",
  "actor": { "player": "<player>", "agent": "sync-agent" },
  "payload": {}
}
```

Do not emit `Sync.Completed` if either rebase or align step failed.

## Guardrails

- Do not rewrite product decisions while doing consistency work.
- Do not duplicate Product Deck, Service Deck, OBC, or Reliability Plan content
  inside skills.
- Prefer references to canonical ProdOps paths.
- Never discard local changes.
- Never force-push or rewrite shared branch history unless the user explicitly
  requests it.
- Do not auto-stash unknown user work without approval.
- If conflicts occur, inspect both sides before editing.
- After conflict resolution, run tests that cover the conflicted files.
- Do not delete or weaken tests just to make synchronization pass.
