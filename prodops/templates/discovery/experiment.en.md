# Upstream Experiment

Canonical location:

```text
prodops/artifacts/experiments/NNN-short-slug/experiment.md
```

Each experiment must also have:

```text
prodops/artifacts/experiments/NNN-short-slug/upstream-trail.md
prodops/artifacts/experiments/NNN-short-slug/evidence/
prodops/artifacts/experiments/NNN-short-slug/features/   ← BDD Features (created during the experiment)
prodops/artifacts/experiments/NNN-short-slug/obcs/       ← OBC drafts (created during the experiment)
```

`features/` and `obcs/` are created as needed. Artifacts stay here until `move-to-downstream`, when they are moved to `prodops/artifacts/bdd/` and `prodops/artifacts/obcs/`.

Do not create experiment files directly in `prodops/artifacts/experiments/` — always inside a subdirectory with a slug.

# Business Goal

Describe the expected business outcome of this experiment.

Why is this experiment being executed?

---

# Repository Scope Gate

Confirm whether this experiment can be developed or validated in this repository.

## Scope of responsibility of this repository

Mark all applicable items:

- [ ] Payments API behavior
- [ ] Payments domain logic
- [ ] Provider integration
- [ ] Webhook processing
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] API/event contract owned by Payments
- [ ] Local tests or executable evidence

## External dependencies

List dependencies that are the responsibility of another repository, team, system, vendor, or platform.

Examples:

- Checkout Feature Flag
- Checkout rollout targeting
- Notification Service delivery
- Order Management fulfillment
- Corporate ITSM integration

## Scope decision

Choose one:

- [ ] Proceed as an Upstream experiment executable in this repository
- [ ] Record only as external dependency or release risk
- [ ] Redirect to the responsible repository or team

If this repository cannot develop or validate the capability, stop here. Do not create BDD Features, OBC drafts, prototypes, or implementation artifacts for this request in this repository.

# Question to Answer

List the questions this experiment must answer.

Examples:

- Can this capability be implemented?
- Is the provider API sufficient?
- Which architecture should be adopted?
- Can the business flow be reproduced locally?

---

# Hypothesis
