# Canonical Paths

Canonical locations for all ProdOps artifacts and resources.
Use this table as the primary navigation source before reading or writing any artifact.

> **Scope:** This file describes only canonical ProdOps Framework paths — structures and artifacts that must exist equally in any product consuming the Framework. Product-local paths (artifacts, operational configuration, and product-specific skills) are declared in `prodops/exec/manifest.yaml` and are not part of this canonical source.

## Framework Engineering References

## Empirical Upstream — Reconciliation with the Framework

> **Restricted scope:** The files below belong to the reconciliation process with
> the existing canonical `prodops-framework` repository. They exist **only while this repository
> is the empirical upstream** (`status: self` in `prodops/exec/framework-lock.yaml`).
> After transitioning to `status: consumer`, they may be removed or kept as
> historical record. They are not part of the canonical Framework's functional content.

| Concern | Canonical path |
|---|---|
| Declarative extraction contract | `prodops/exec/export-manifest.yaml` |
| Boundary model documentation (PT) | `prodops/exec/export-boundary.md` |
| Boundary model documentation (EN) | `prodops/exec/export-boundary.en.md` |
| Export boundary validation script | `prodops/scripts/validate-export-manifest.sh` |
| Empirical role orientation (PT) | `prodops/exec/empirical-upstream.md` |
| Empirical role orientation (EN) | `prodops/exec/empirical-upstream.en.md` |

> **Sync mechanism:** `scripts/sync-framework-docs.sh` is NOT a canonical script —
> it is disabled (guard at the beginning of the file). It must not be executed until
> aligned with `export-manifest.yaml`. Do not list as a canonical script.

## Legacy Paths

| `prodops/assessment/reliability-plans/` | `prodops/artifacts/plans/reliability/` |
| `prodops/downstream/release-trail.md` | `prodops/artifacts/trails/release-trail.md` |
