# ProdOps Artifact Governance

This document defines the governance of all ProdOps Framework artifacts: where each artifact is born, who is responsible, who can modify it, who approves changes, who consumes it, and which journeys it participates in.

→ [Backlog hierarchy](backlogs.en.md)
→ [Operating model](operating-model.en.md)

---

## Governance Principles

1. **Each artifact has exactly one Owner.** No artifact has two owners.
2. **Each artifact has a single source of truth.** The same artifact must not exist duplicated in two repositories.
3. **Every artifact belongs to exactly one architecture level.** Framework, Portfolio, Workspace, or Product Repository.
4. **Approvals occur only at points defined by the Framework.** No implicit or ad hoc approvals.
5. **Every artifact has a clearly defined lifecycle.** Creation, evolution, and closure are documented.
6. **Skills never generate information that replaces the OBC.** New artifacts produced by Skills complement or reference the OBC.

---

## Role of each architecture level

### Framework (ProdOps Framework)

- Defines standards, journeys, templates, Skills, validations, and canonical terminology.
- Does not govern products, Roadmaps, or product backlogs.
- Provides the model that other levels adopt.
- Repository: `prodops-framework` (canonical reference; documented in this repository as reference implementation).

### Portfolio (ProdOps Portfolio)

- Manages the Portfolio Tracking List (Business Signals), Business Intent Backlog (Business Intents), Roadmap (VIEW over BIB), Platform Releases (VIEW over BIB), and Milestones.
- Decides what the platform delivers, when, and in what sequence.
- Does not implement software directly.
- Repository: `prodops-portfolio` (not yet created; concepts documented here as reference).

### Workspace (ProdOps Workspace)

- Integrates multiple Product Repositories for joint execution and testing.
- Does not govern Backlogs, does not govern Roadmaps, does not create Business Intents.
- Coordinates exclusively the integrated execution between Product Repositories.
- Repository: `prodops-workspace` (not yet created; concepts documented here as reference).

### Product Repository

- Implements and operates a specific product.
- Governs Product Tracking List (Business Signals), Product Backlog (Business Intents), Icebox (VIEW), Iteration Backlog (VIEW), Release (VIEW), Iteration Plan, OBCs, Reliability Plans.
- Each repository that consumes the Framework is a Product Repository.

## Global flow (Portfolio → Product)

```
Portfolio Tracking List
  ↓ Business Signal generates Business Intent
Business Intent Backlog       ← Global OBC Draft born here
  ↓ prioritized
  ├─ Roadmap [VIEW over BIB]
  └─ Platform Release [VIEW over BIB]
  ↓ accepted by Product Owner
Product Backlog
```

## Local flow (Product)

```
Product Tracking List
  ↓ Business Signal → Business Intent + Owner Approval
Product Backlog               ← Local OBC Draft born here if not yet existing
```

## Convergence — Delivery flow

```
Product Backlog
  ↓ VIEW Icebox — Discovery
Icebox [VIEW]
  ↓ OBC Committed
Iteration Backlog [VIEW]
  ↓ OBC committed + BDD committed
Iteration Plan
  ↓
Delivery (CI Sync → CI Async)
  ↓
Operation
```

## Governance of Platform artifacts

### Portfolio Tracking List

| **Where born** | Portfolio — any platform Business Signal without sufficient understanding |
| **Repository** | `prodops-portfolio` (external; referenced, not replicated) |
| **Who modifies** | Portfolio Product Manager, authorized stakeholders |
| **Who approves** | Portfolio Product Manager |
| **Consumers** | Business Intent Backlog (when Business Signal generates a Business Intent) |
| **Lifecycle** | Business Signal created → investigated → generates Business Intent (advances to BIB) or discarded |
| **Journeys** | Assessment (Portfolio) |

### Business Intent Backlog

| **Repository** | `prodops-portfolio` (external) |
| **Who modifies** | Portfolio Product Manager |
| **Who approves** | Portfolio Product Manager |
| **Consumers** | Roadmap (VIEW), Platform Release (VIEW), Product Backlog (via OBC Partitioning) |
| **OBC** | Global OBC Draft created upon entry to this backlog |

| **Journeys** | Assessment (Portfolio), Discovery (Upstream) |

### Roadmap (VIEW over Business Intent Backlog)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Portfolio |
| **Nature** | VIEW over the Business Intent Backlog — not a separate backlog |
| **Where born** | Portfolio — Business Intent positioned in a strategic horizon |
| **Repository** | GitHub Projects (Views of the Portfolio GitHub Project) |
| **Who modifies** | Portfolio Product Manager |
| **Who approves** | Portfolio Leadership |
| **Consumers** | Platform Release (VIEW), Product Repositories |
| **Lifecycle** | Business Intent positioned in horizon → committed to Platform Release |
| **Journeys** | Assessment (Portfolio), Diligence |

### Platform Release (VIEW over Business Intent Backlog)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Portfolio |
| **Nature** | VIEW over the Business Intent Backlog — not a separate backlog |
| **Where born** | Portfolio — set of Business Intents grouped for coordinated delivery |
| **Repository** | `prodops-portfolio` (external) / GitHub Projects (Views of the Portfolio GitHub Project) |
| **Who modifies** | Portfolio Manager |
| **Who approves** | Portfolio Leadership |
| **Consumers** | Product Backlog (Product Repositories via OBC Partitioning), Workspace |
| **Lifecycle** | Planned → committed → distributed to repositories → validated in Workspace |
| **Journeys** | Delivery (Workspace), Assessment (Portfolio) |

## Governance of Product Repository artifacts

| **Contains** | ONLY Business Signals |
| **Where born** | Product Repository — any local Business Signal not yet understood |
| **Canonical artifact** | `prodops/artifacts/product/backlogs/tracking-list.md` |
| **Who modifies** | Any team member |
| **Who approves** | Product Owner |
| **Consumers** | Product Backlog (when Business Signal generates a Business Intent via Premortem + Owner Approval) |
| **Entry criteria** | Any Business Signal — business, technical, or operational — without commitment |
