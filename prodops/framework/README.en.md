# ProdOps Framework

ProdOps is a product-driven engineering framework. It organizes work into five journeys (Discovery, Delivery, Operation, Assessment, Diligence) executed in two modes (Upstream or Downstream), connected by shared practices, contracts, and evidence.

This directory contains the canonical ProdOps Framework documentation. The content here defines the Framework — each consumer product adopts and extends it with its own local artifacts.

> **Where the Framework lives:** The canonical repository is [produtoreativo/prodops-framework](https://github.com/produtoreativo/prodops-framework). For now, Framework and Runtime are also being developed in the RI [produtoreativo/payments-api](https://github.com/produtoreativo/payments-api) — synchronized at every change while maturing toward Release Candidate. Once RC is declared, the RI becomes a pure consumer and this repo becomes the sole source of authority.

| [contributor-philosophy.md](contributor-philosophy.md) | **Contributor philosophy** — where each change belongs (Framework vs Runtime vs Agents), the four design qualifiers, and how to evolve without accumulating inconsistency |

## OBC Templates

| Template | When to use |
|---|---|
| [templates/obcs/global-obc.en.md](../templates/obcs/global-obc.en.md) | Create a Global OBC in the BIB (strategic business contract) |
| [templates/obcs/local-obc.en.md](../templates/obcs/local-obc.en.md) | Create a Local OBC in the Product Backlog (product implementation contract) |

## OBC Partitioning

**OBC Partitioning** is the governance process that transforms a Global OBC into Local OBCs — one per product involved. It occurs after Discovery in the BIB. Executed by Portfolio PM + Tech Leads.
