# ProdOps Glossary

Canonical terms of the ProdOps Framework. One concept = one name. One name = one concept.

For the **canonical hierarchy of structural concepts** (Framework, Execution Model, Journey, Cycle, Phase, Capability, Skill, Step), see [`ontology.en.md`](ontology.en.md).
For the full Framework flow, see [`flow.md`](flow.en.md).
For the four Origin Streams, see [`origin-streams.md`](origin-streams.en.md).
For the backlog hierarchy, see [`backlogs.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## ProdOps Architecture

The four hierarchical levels that compose the ProdOps ecosystem. See [operating-model.en.md](operating-model.en.md#prodops-architecture) for the full diagram.

---

## Framework (ProdOps Framework)

**Definition:** The canonical system of principles, journeys, capabilities, skills, templates, standards, contracts, and glossary that defines how ProdOps works. Lives in a dedicated reference repository.

**Purpose:** Be the single source of truth about how to work with ProdOps — regardless of which product, portfolio, or workspace is using it.

**Contains:** Principles, glossary, official flow, Origin Streams, operating model, journeys, skills, templates, Delivery Capabilities.

**Does not contain:** Roadmap, Backlogs, Business Intents, Releases, product Features.

**Relation to other concepts:** The Framework is the top level of the hierarchy. Portfolio, Workspace, and Product Repositories adopt and extend it with their own artifacts.

---

## Portfolio

**Definition:** The platform management level of ProdOps. Responsible for coordinating multiple products, defining priorities, and managing platform versions.

**Purpose:** Decide what the platform delivers, when, and in what sequence — without directly implementing software.

**Contains:** Portfolio Tracking List (Business Signals), Business Intent Backlog (Business Intents), Roadmaps (view of BIB), Platform Releases (view of BIB), Milestones.

**Does not contain:** Software implementation, product OBCs, product BDD Features.

**Relation to other concepts:** The Portfolio sits between the Framework (which defines the rules) and the Workspaces (which execute). A Portfolio Roadmap coordinates Product Repositories. See **Platform Release**.

---

## Workspace

**Definition:** The product integration level. Responsible for running and testing multiple Product Repositories together.

**Purpose:** Ensure that products that depend on each other work correctly in an integrated manner. A Workspace has no Roadmap and no Business Intents — it exists exclusively for integration.

**Operational characteristics:** The Workspace has no state of its own. It observes GitHub (the primary operational source) and never decides priorities — priorities are decided by the Portfolio (Business Intents) or by the Product Owner (OBCs in the Product Backlog).

**Examples:** Checkout Workspace (webshop-api + payments-api + order-mgmt-api).

**Does not contain:** Roadmap, Business Intents, product code, backlog state.

**Relation to other concepts:** A Workspace is coordinated by the Portfolio and integrates Product Repositories. See **Product Repository**.

---

## Product Repository

**Definition:** The implementation and operation level for a specific product within the ProdOps architecture. Each repository that consumes the Framework is a Product Repository.

**Purpose:** Implement Product Capabilities, operate the product in production, and maintain full traceability from Business Intents to operation evidence.

**Contains:** OBCs, BDD Features, Iteration Plans, Reliability Plans, Release Trail, product code, runbooks, postmortems.

**Relation to other concepts:** A Product Repository adopts the Framework, participates in Roadmaps defined by the Portfolio, and is integrated by Workspaces. It can also evolve locally through its own Business Intent flow.

---

## Platform

**Definition:** The set of Product Repositories coordinated by the Portfolio and integrated by Workspaces. The platform is the composite product — what the end customer experiences.

**Relation to other concepts:** The Platform is the result of coordination between Portfolio, Workspaces, and Product Repositories. See **Portfolio**, **Workspace**, **Product Repository**.

---

## Platform Release

**Definition:** A grouping view over the Business Intent Backlog — not a separate backlog. Represents which BIB items compose a coherent platform delivery (a specific combination of Product Repository versions to be released together).

**Nature:** View — not a queue. Items do not "pass through" the Platform Release; they remain in the BIB and are associated with a platform version.

**Purpose:** Mark a coherent delivery point for the platform as a whole — not just for a single product.

**Distinction:** A Platform Release is different from a local release of a single Product Repository. The local release (managed by the repository's CI Async) contributes to a Platform Release but does not replace it.

**Relation to other concepts:** Managed by the Portfolio. View over the Business Intent Backlog. See **Portfolio**, **Roadmap**.

---

## Roadmap

**Definition:** A strategic view over the Business Intent Backlog — not a separate backlog. Organizes BIB items by delivery horizon (now / next / later), Milestones, and cross-product dependencies.

**Nature:** View — not a queue. Items do not "enter" the Roadmap; they remain in the BIB and receive a position in the strategic horizon.

**Purpose:** Communicate platform priorities and delivery horizon to stakeholders, teams, and partners without creating a commitment.

**Who manages it:** The Portfolio. Product Repositories participate in Roadmaps but do not define them.

**Do not confuse with:** Iteration Plan (planning for one iteration within a Product Repository) or Icebox (candidates not yet prioritized).

**Relation to other concepts:** View over the Business Intent Backlog, managed by the Portfolio. See **Portfolio**, **Platform Release**, **Business Intent Backlog**.

---

## Origin Stream

**Definition:** Classification of the origin of an Intent. Identifies where the need was born and who owns it.

**Purpose:** Ensure that every change has a traceable origin and that the context, language, and success criteria are appropriate for the type of need.

**When to use:** When registering any Intent. Every Intent has exactly one Origin Stream.

**When not to use:** Origin Stream does not determine the execution mode or the journey — that is the function of the Execution Mode and Continuous Assessment.

**The four Origin Streams:** Business | Enterprise | Team | Technology

**Relationship with other concepts:** An Origin Stream generates a **Business Signal**. When investigated and recognized as strategic, a Business Signal can generate one or more **Business Intents**. See [`origin-streams.md`](origin-streams.en.md).

---

## Business Signal

**Definition:** Represents any opportunity, hypothesis, problem, benchmark, business case, value stream, complaint, new technology, or idea that deserves attention. Not a commitment. Not a contract. No OBC.

**Purpose:** Capture any signal that deserves investigation before any strategic or investment decision. Business Signals are the raw material from which strategic work is identified.

**When to use:** When registering a need not yet structured enough to be treated as a formal Business Intent. Every item captured in Tracking Lists is a Business Signal.

**Life cycle:** Persists even after generating Business Intents — represents the discovery history. A Business Signal can generate 0, 1, or N Business Intents.

**Lives in:** Portfolio Tracking List (platform) or Product Tracking List (product).

**Execution Space representation:** A Business Signal has no permanent GitHub Issue representation. Work Items are created when there is an active operation over the Signal (e.g., exploration, triage, promotion). A Signal can have zero or more Work Items across its lifetime. See [knowledge-vs-execution.en.md](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md).

**Critical rule:** Entities never change identity. A Business Signal never "becomes" a Business Intent — it **generates** new Business Intent entities.

**Relationship with other concepts:** 1 Business Signal → 0 to N Business Intents. See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Business Intent

**Definition:** Represents a strategic decision: there is clarity about which value will be pursued. Born from a Business Signal (or multiple). Has its own identity and lifecycle — does not replace the Business Signal.

**Purpose:** Formally register an investment decision before any implementation decision. The Business Intent captures the "why" without prescribing the "how".

**When to use:** When a Business Signal has been investigated and recognized as strategically relevant. Every change that enters the Business Intent Backlog is represented as a Business Intent.

**When not to use:** Business Intent is not a technical backlog, sprint task, or isolated bug ticket. It does not represent implementation — it represents strategic decision.

**Life cycle:** The Business Intent is born in the Business Intent Backlog (global flow) — at which point the Global OBC is created as a Draft. Has an OBC as its contract document — the OBC represents the commitment across 4 dimensions: Business, Enterprise, Team, and Technology. OBC Partitioning creates Local OBC documents (Markdown files) per product, but the Intent remains the trackable entity.

**Origin:** Can be created directly in the Business Intent Backlog without originating from a Business Signal. When generated from a Business Signal, it stores an optional back-reference to the originating Signal.

**Execution Space representation:** Work Items are created when there are active operations over the Intent (e.g., exploration, refinement, promotion). An Intent can have zero or more Work Items across its lifetime. See [knowledge-vs-execution.en.md](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md).

**Relationship with other concepts:** Born from a Business Signal (or created directly in the BIB). Has an OBC as its contract document. See [`flow.en.md`](flow.en.md), [`origin-streams.en.md`](origin-streams.en.md) and [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Product Stage

**Definition:** Classification of a product's maturity moment within the ProdOps lifecycle. Defines which delivery metrics carry the most weight and what the team's focus should be at that point.

**The six stages in order:** PoC → MVP → IPR → MVR → MVT → MLP

**Two macro-phases:**
- **Hypothesis Validation** (PoC, MVP, IPR): prove the idea is viable before scaling
- **Acceleration** (MVR, MVT, MLP): grow with repeatability, traction, and delight

**Relationship with other concepts:** The stage influences DORA metric weights and Reliability Plan focus. See [`product-stages.en.md`](product-stages.en.md) and [`dora-metrics.en.md`](dora-metrics.en.md).

---

## PoC (Proof of Concept)

**Definition:** First product stage. Validates whether an idea or approach is viable with a **real customer**.

**Central characteristic:** The customer is always involved. No customer means it is not a PoC — it is a Spike Solution.

**Relationship with other concepts:** See **Product Stage**, **Spike Solution**, and [`product-stages.en.md`](product-stages.en.md).

---

## DORA Metrics (Extended)

**Definition:** A 7-metric delivery health model adopted by ProdOps to assess delivery maturity. Extends the 4 original metrics from the DORA Research Program with 3 product- and operation-oriented extensions.

**The 7 metrics:**

| Metric | Type | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Lead Time for Change** | DORA Core | Time from commit to production |
| **Release Frequency** | DORA Core | Deployment frequency |
| **Change Fail Rate** | DORA Core | % of changes that cause failure |
| **Mean Time to Recovery** | DORA Core | Mean time to recovery after failure |
| **Reaction Time** | ProdOps Extension | Time between external signal and first processed action |
| **Rate of Return** | ProdOps Extension | Escaped defects and rework — retries, refunds |
| **Availability** | ProdOps Extension | Service operational uptime |

**Weights by stage:** each product stage defines weights 1–8 per metric. In early stages (PoC/MVP), Lead Time and Reaction Time carry maximum weight. In advanced stages (MVT/MLP), Change Fail Rate, MTTR, and Availability dominate.

**Relationship with other concepts:** See [`dora-metrics.en.md`](dora-metrics.en.md), [`product-stages.en.md`](product-stages.en.md). Maturity assessment is run on the Certificare platform.

---

## Maturity Level (Delivery)

**Definition:** ProdOps delivery maturity scale, from 0 to 5. Used by Certificare to position the product and generate an improvement roadmap.

| Level | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Inexistent | No established practices |
| 1 | Initial | Ad-hoc practices, no repeatability |
| 2 | Repeatable | Basic practices without systematization |
| 3 | Defined | Documented processes consistently followed |
| 4 | Managed | Metrics collected and used for decisions |
| 5 | Excellence | Continuous optimization based on data |

**Top-down strategy:** starts at level 5 and drops at the first unsatisfied mandatory criterion.

**Relationship with other concepts:** See [`dora-metrics.en.md`](dora-metrics.en.md).

---

## Spike Solution

**Definition:** A time-boxed technical investigation whose only output is a decision — not a product, not deliverable code. It answers a single specific technical question that is blocking progress.

**Central characteristic:** No customer is ever involved. If there is a customer, it is a PoC. Code is always disposable.

**When to use:** Any product stage, any experiment phase — including inside a PoC or any Upstream journey.

**Critical difference from PoC:**

| | PoC | Spike Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Customer involved | Always | Never |
| Objective | Validate with real feedback | Answer a technical question |
| Code | May be demonstrable | Always disposable |

**Where to record:** `prodops/framework/journeys/discovery/spikes.md` (if isolated) or the experiment's `upstream-trail.md` (if inside an active Upstream).

**Relationship with other concepts:** See **PoC**, **Product Stage**, [`product-stages.en.md`](product-stages.en.md), and [`journeys/discovery/spikes.md`](journeys/discovery/spikes.md).

---

## Conception

**Definition:** Phase covering the period from the emergence of a Business Signal to entry into the Product Backlog. The Business Signal exists as a possibility — the Product Owner has not yet made a commitment.

**Central question:** Is there real value here?

**Backlogs:** Portfolio Tracking List / Product Tracking List → Business Intent Backlog (global flow).

**OBC state:** Does not exist in the Tracking Lists. In the global flow, the **Global OBC** is born as Draft upon entry into the Business Intent Backlog — when the Business Signal generates a Business Intent. In the local flow, the **Local OBC** is born as Draft upon entry into the Product Backlog.

**Commitment:** None. The Business Signal may be discarded without any formal record of learning.

**Exit boundary:** Owner Approval — entry into the Product Backlog (start of Inception).

**Relationship with other concepts:** See [`phases.en.md`](phases.en.md), [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Inception

**Definition:** Phase covering the period from entry into the Product Backlog until the Local OBC reaches the Committed state (Iteration Backlog). The Product Owner has made a formal commitment to investigate.

**Central question:** Is the Product Owner committing attention and capacity to investigate this now?

**Backlogs:** Product Backlog → Icebox → Iteration Backlog.

**Local OBC state:** Draft → Refining (Icebox) → Committed (Iteration Backlog).

**Commitment:** Formal. Any closure requires a traceable learning record in the OBC.

**Execution mode:** Upstream or Downstream — they are **modes**, not phases. Defined by the Product Owner when accepting the Business Intent into the Product Backlog. May change during Inception.

**Exit boundary:** Assessment Review approved, Local OBC in Committed state, BDD Feature committed — entry into the Iteration Backlog.

**Relationship with other concepts:** See [`phases.en.md`](phases.en.md), [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Business (Origin Stream)

**Definition:** Origin Stream that represents needs generated by the market, the customer, or product growth opportunities.

**Purpose:** Capture market-outcome-oriented Intents — revenue, conversion, adoption, retention, new channels, new products.

**When to use:** The need has a direct relationship with value perceived by the customer or the market.

**When not to use:** If the benefit is internal to the organization (Enterprise), to the team's process (Team), or to the technical platform (Technology).

**Examples:** Split Payment (Pix + Card), new Boleto channel, subscription recurrence support.

**Relationship with other concepts:** One of the four Origin Streams. See [`origin-streams.md`](origin-streams.en.md).

---

## Enterprise (Origin Stream)

**Definition:** Origin Stream that represents internal organizational needs — compliance, legislation, audit, partners, ERP, financial, backoffice, governance, corporate risks.

**Purpose:** Capture Intents that are mandatory for reasons external to the product — laws, regulations, contracts, corporate policies.

**When to use:** The need is imposed from outside the product or resolves an internal operational scale problem.

**When not to use:** If the benefit is for the customer (Business), for the team's process (Team), or for the platform (Technology).

**Examples:** Compliance with Central Bank regulation, integration with financial ERP, LGPD data retention policy.

**Relationship with other concepts:** One of the four Origin Streams. See [`origin-streams.md`](origin-streams.en.md).

---

## Team (Origin Stream)

**Definition:** Origin Stream that represents needs generated by the product and engineering team itself to evolve the way of working, processes, tools, and operational quality.

**Purpose:** Capture Intents for internal operational model improvement — productivity, onboarding, workflow, automations.

**When to use:** The need is about how the team works, not what the team delivers to the market.

**When not to use:** If the benefit is for the customer (Business), for the organization (Enterprise), or for the technical platform (Technology).

**Examples:** Adoption of Conventional Commits, creation of Bootstrap skill, Commit Workflow documentation.

**Relationship with other concepts:** One of the four Origin Streams. See [`origin-streams.md`](origin-streams.en.md).

---

## Technology (Origin Stream)

**Definition:** Origin Stream that represents needs generated by the evolution of the platform's technical capabilities, security, infrastructure, and system reliability.

**Purpose:** Capture technical evolution Intents — architecture, security, infrastructure, observability, reliability, cloud, database, Kubernetes, serverless, IAM, cryptography.

**When to use:** The need is technical and the primary benefit is for the system — not directly for the customer or the organization.

**When not to use:** If the technical improvement is a consequence of a product requirement (Business), corporate requirement (Enterprise), or process requirement (Team).

**Examples:** Migration to DynamoDB, automatic credential rotation, adoption of OpenTelemetry, encryption at rest.

**Relationship with other concepts:** One of the four Origin Streams. See [`origin-streams.md`](origin-streams.en.md).

---

## OBC (Observable Business Contract)

**Definition:** The living contract representing a business intent throughout its entire lifecycle. It is the source of truth for the work — connecting business, product, architecture, engineering, operation, observability, and reliability.

**Two levels:**
- **Global OBC** — strategic, belongs to BIB/Portfolio, covers the entire business intent.
- **Local OBC** — product-specific, belongs to one Product Backlog, specializes/partitions the Global OBC.

**States (contract maturity):** Draft → Refining → Committed → In Delivery → Operational → Archived.

**Creation:** Born when a Business Intent is accepted. There is no OBC for Business Signals — the OBC is only born from Business Intents. In the global flow, a **Global OBC Draft** is born upon entry into the Business Intent Backlog. In the local flow, a **Local OBC Draft** is born upon entry into the Product Backlog (either via OBC Partitioning or direct local approval).

**Relationship with other concepts:** Anchors the BDD Feature, the Iteration Plan, the Reliability Plan, and all of Delivery. Diligence keeps the OBC state synchronized across backlogs and tools. The relationship between levels is always: 1 Global OBC → N Local OBCs.

→ **Full definition, composition, lifecycle, and governance:** [`obc.en.md`](obc.en.md)

---

## Global OBC

**Definition:** Strategic-level Observable Business Contract. Represents the complete business intent — before it is decomposed by product.

**Focus:** Business goal, value, stakeholders, business rules, business events, KPIs, and the platform as a whole. Does **not** contain technical implementation details.

**Content:**
- Business Goal
- Business Value
- Stakeholders
- Business Rules
- Business Events table
- KPIs / Expected Outcomes
- Value Stream
- Products Involved
- Local OBC Traceability table (links to all derived Local OBCs)
- Discovery Notes

**Location:** Platform portfolio repository (external to product repositories).

**Lifecycle:** Draft → Refining (during Discovery in BIB) → Operational (after all derived Local OBCs are in production) → Archived

**Owner:** Portfolio PM

**Relationship with other concepts:** A Global OBC is decomposed into Local OBCs via **OBC Partitioning**. The relationship is: 1 Global OBC → N Local OBCs. Terms allowed: decomposition, specialization, partition. Terms **not** allowed: parent, child, inheritance.

→ [`obc.en.md`](obc.en.md)

---

## Local OBC

**Definition:** Product-level Observable Business Contract. Represents the specific responsibility of one product. It may specialize a Global OBC or originate directly from a local Intent.

**Focus:** Implementation contract — APIs, events, BDD, observability, reliability, response contract. **Does not duplicate** strategic content from the Global OBC.

**Content:**
- Mandatory origin reference: Global OBC in the global flow or Intent + Repository Tracking Item in the local flow
- Product / Repo / Bounded Context
- APIs and Events (this product's responsibility)
- BDD / Acceptance Criteria
- Observable Events table
- Reliability Rules
- Response Contract
- Technical Dependencies
- Evidence (after Delivery)

**Location:** `prodops/artifacts/obcs/<slug>.md` (when committed)

**Lifecycle:** Draft → Refining (Icebox) → Committed (Iteration Backlog) → In Delivery → Operational (Operation) → Archived

**Owner:** Product Manager + Tech Lead of the product

**Belongs to:** Exactly one Product Backlog.

**Relationship with other concepts:** In the global flow, each Local OBC derives from exactly one Global OBC and never duplicates its strategic content. In the local flow, it directly represents an accepted Business Intent and references its Product Tracking List item.

→ [`obc.en.md`](obc.en.md)

---

## OBC Partitioning

**Definition:** A governance process responsible for partitioning a Global OBC into Local OBCs — one for each product involved in delivering the business intent. Not a Framework Capability — it is a point-in-time activity of human responsibility.

**When it happens:** After Discovery in the Business Intent Backlog, when the Global OBC is sufficiently understood to identify the involved products and their responsibilities.

**Who executes:** Portfolio PM + Tech Leads of the involved products.

**What is produced:**
- Local OBC Draft for each product
- Traceability table updated in the Global OBC (linking all derived Local OBCs)
- Items created in the Product Backlogs of the involved products

**Relationship with other concepts:** OBC Partitioning is the transition step between the BIB and the Product Backlogs. It does not split the Business Intent — it specializes the responsibility per product. After Partitioning, each Product Backlog receives its Local OBC Draft and begins refinement in the Icebox.

→ [`obc.en.md`](obc.en.md#obc-partitioning)

---

## Continuous OBC Refinement

**Definition:** The process by which both Global OBC and Local OBCs evolve continuously throughout the product lifecycle — during Discovery, Delivery, and Operation. An OBC is never finalized; it accumulates evidence and evolves with the product.

**Drivers:** New operational evidence, incidents, postmortems, market changes, new measurements, strategic decisions.

**What is updated:** KPIs, observable events, response contract, reliability rules, business rules, stakeholders, discovery notes.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Continuous OBC Refinement is the last step of the official flow — and generates new Intents that restart the cycle. See [`flow.en.md`](flow.en.md), step 11.

---

## Exploration

**Definition:** Step of the Framework flow between Intent and OBC. Reduces uncertainty by transforming hypotheses into validated knowledge.

**Purpose:** Ensure that the OBC is built on real understanding, not assumptions. Without sufficient Exploration, the OBC is fragile.

**When to use:** Whenever the Intent has unvalidated hypotheses, open domain decisions, or technical uncertainty that justifies exploration before commitment.

**When not to use:** When the Intent is trivial, the behavior is already well understood, and the OBC can be written directly. In this case, Exploration is short or nonexistent.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Exploration is implemented by the Discovery Journey in both modes. Discovery describes the journey; Upstream or Downstream defines the commitment level and rigor.

| Term | Level | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Exploration** | Flow step | What happens: uncertainty reduction between Intent and OBC |
| **Discovery** | Journey | The name of the Framework journey that implements Exploration |
| **Upstream / Downstream** | Execution Mode | The commitment level and rigor applied during Discovery |

Exploration operates on OBC Drafts that were born at the Business Intent Backlog (global flow) or Product Backlog (local flow) and are being refined in the Icebox.

See [`flow.en.md`](flow.en.md), [`journeys/discovery/README.en.md`](journeys/discovery/README.en.md) and [`execution-model/upstream.en.md`](execution-model/upstream.en.md).

---

## Discovery

**Definition:** ProdOps Framework journey that implements the Exploration step. Exploratory engineering flow oriented to learning.

**Purpose:** Transform hypotheses into validated knowledge through experiments, spikes, and prototypes. Produce the Decision Package that grounds the OBC.

**When to use:** When exploring an Intent in Upstream or Downstream, with the rigor corresponding to the mode.

**When not to use:** Discovery is not synonymous with Upstream (Upstream is the mode, Discovery is the journey). Discovery does not produce production software — it produces knowledge.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Discovery is the journey that implements Exploration. The execution mode (Upstream or Downstream) defines the commitment level and required rigor. See [`journeys/discovery/README.en.md`](journeys/discovery/README.en.md).

---

## Framework Capability

**Definition:** Reusable ProdOps process mechanism — can be consumed by any Journey or Phase that needs it. Not associated with a specific product; it is process infrastructure, not a product feature.

**Groups by area of origin** (not exclusive ownership):
- *Delivery area:* Commit Workflow, Contract Management, Evidence Management, Observability, Reliability
- *Diligence area:* Backlog Synchronization, Work Item Management, Readiness Verification, Divergence Detection, Artifact Evolution, Workspace Reconciliation

**Distinction:** _Framework Capability_ is the canonical concept. "Delivery Capability" and "Diligence Capability" are area qualifiers — they remain Framework Capabilities. "Product Capability" is the opposite concept: the object of work, not the mechanism.

→ Full definition: [`ontology.md — Capability`](ontology.md)

---

## Delivery Capability

**Definition:** **Framework Capability** of the Delivery area — reusable mechanism consumed by the Phases of the Delivery journey. Examples: Commit Workflow, Contract Management, Evidence Management, Observability, Reliability.

**Purpose:** Encapsulate cross-cutting technical practices that can be invoked by multiple phases without duplication.

**When to use:** When referencing the technical infrastructure of the delivery process.

**When not to use:** Do not confuse with "Product Capability". A Delivery Capability is a Framework mechanism, not a product feature.

**Relationship with other concepts:** It is a Framework Capability specialized for the Delivery area. See [`journeys/delivery/capabilities/`](journeys/delivery/capabilities/).

---

## Product Capability

**Definition:** A product feature, behavior, or characteristic being explored or delivered. Examples: split payment, Pix support, payment confirmation webhook.

**Purpose:** Name the product work scope that an Intent originates and that an OBC describes.

**When to use:** When referencing what is being built — the feature, the behavior, the product value.

**When not to use:** Do not confuse with "Delivery Capability". A Product Capability is the object of work; a Delivery Capability is a process mechanism.

**Note:** In contexts where ambiguity is possible, prefer the full term "Product Capability" or "Delivery Capability" instead of just "capability".

---

## Product Topology

**Definition:** The permanent structural organization of a product. Describes the four dimensions that coexist in any product and over which OBCs produce changes via Delivery.

**Purpose:** Identify which parts of the product structure are affected by an OBC — independent of where the intent originated (Origin Stream) and independent of the delivery process.

**The four Product Dimensions:** Team · Flow · Data · Components

**Required ontological separation:**
- **Origin Streams** answer: "Where did this need come from?" (origin of the intent)
- **Product Topology** answers: "Which parts of the product will be impacted?" (permanent structure)

**Does not represent:** Backlog, journey, pipeline, work flow, or process lifecycle. Product Topology describes the structure of the product — not the process of building it.

**Never use as a substitute:** Layers, Domains, Views, Perspectives, Streams.

→ **Full definition with diagram and examples:** [`product-topology.en.md`](product-topology.en.md)

---

## Team (Product Dimension)

**Definition:** The organizational dimension of Product Topology. Describes the ownership, responsibilities, capabilities, roles, collaboration, governance, and operational model of the team that builds and operates the product.

**When an OBC impacts this dimension:** When delivery creates new operational responsibilities, redefines roles between teams, or changes the product's governance model.

**Critical distinction:** Do not confuse with the "Team" Origin Stream — which classifies the *origin* of a need (the team identified the problem). The "Team" Product Dimension describes the *impact* on the product's organizational structure.

**Relation to other concepts:** One of the four Product Dimensions. See [`product-topology.en.md`](product-topology.en.md).

---

## Flow (Product Dimension)

**Definition:** The temporal axis of Product Topology. Represents how the other Product Dimensions (Team, Data, Components) evolve across the Framework journeys — Discovery, Delivery, Operation, Diligence, and future journeys. Flow does not execute anything: it records the evolution, transformation, and history of changes over time.

**When an OBC impacts this dimension:** Always — every OBC, as it traverses the Framework journeys, always leaves a temporal trace. Flow records that traversal: when the OBC was born (Discovery), implemented (Delivery), entered production (Operation), and validated (Diligence).

**Critical distinction:** Flow is not product functional behavior. Business processes, business rules, state machines, automations, and features belong to the **Components** dimension — which implements the product's behavior. Flow is exclusively the temporal axis: it answers *when* and *how* dimensions evolve, never *what* the product does.

**Relation to other concepts:** One of the four Product Dimensions; transversal to the others. See [`product-topology.en.md`](product-topology.en.md).

---

## Data (Product Dimension)

**Definition:** The informational dimension of Product Topology. Describes the business entities, data contracts, schemas, persistence, integrations, domain events, and APIs that compose the product's informational model.

**When an OBC impacts this dimension:** When delivery creates new schemas, new domain events, new API contracts, or modifies the existing persistence model.

**Relation to other concepts:** One of the four Product Dimensions. See [`product-topology.en.md`](product-topology.en.md).

---

## Components (Product Dimension)

**Definition:** The physical and behavioral dimension of Product Topology. Describes the applications, services, microservices, databases, queues, data pipelines, infrastructure, and repositories that compose the product's technical platform. **Components implement the product's functional behavior** — they are what execute business rules, features, integrations, APIs, and automated processes. The product's behavior emerges from the collaboration between its Components.

**When an OBC impacts this dimension:** When delivery creates new services, new APIs, new workers, new message queues, new databases, or modifies the existing product infrastructure.

**Relation to other concepts:** One of the four Product Dimensions. See [`product-topology.en.md`](product-topology.en.md).

---

## BDD Feature

**Definition:** Gherkin specification that describes the expected behavior of a Product Capability. Lives in `prodops/artifacts/bdd/` (committed) or `prodops/artifacts/experiments/<NNN-slug>/features/` (exploratory — inside the experiment directory). Used as TDD input in Downstream.

---

## Reliability Plan

**Definition:** Product of the transversal Assessment journey that defines risks, SLOs, and mitigation actions for a committed item. Lives in `prodops/artifacts/plans/reliability/`.

**Requirement level:** Conditional and verifiable. It is a Delivery gate when there is money movement, an external integration, an SLO change, high/critical risk, or a persistence or security change. Outside those triggers it is optional.

**In the local flow (before the Product Backlog):** The Premortem is the appropriate artifact for risk analysis before Owner Approval. The formal Reliability Plan is produced during the Icebox, after the Product Owner's commitment.

---

## Portfolio Tracking List

**Definition:** Platform-level backlog that captures Business Signals not yet understood enough to generate a formal Business Intent. Managed by the Portfolio.

**Contains:** ONLY Business Signals. No Business Intents. No OBCs.

**Question:** What Business Signals deserve attention at the platform level?

**Does not contain:** OBC. Commitment. Permanent identifier.

**Relationship with other concepts:** First level of the global flow. Business Signals advance to the Business Intent Backlog when recognized as strategic — at that point, a new Business Intent entity is created. See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

## Business Intent Backlog

**Definition:** Platform-level backlog representing Business Intents accepted for Discovery. The **Global OBC Draft** is born upon entry into this backlog. After Discovery, **OBC Partitioning** distributes Local OBC Drafts to Product Backlogs. Managed by the Portfolio.

**Contains:** ONLY Business Intents. No Business Signals. Global OBCs are associated with Business Intents here.

**Question:** What Business Intents deserve Discovery at the platform level?

**Relationship with other concepts:** Second level of the global flow. The Global OBC Draft is born here. After Discovery → OBC Partitioning → Local OBC Drafts go to Product Backlogs. See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Product Tracking List

**Definition:** Product-level backlog that captures Business Signals already directed at this specific product or team. Artifact: `prodops/artifacts/product/backlogs/tracking-list.md`.

**Contains:** ONLY Business Signals. No Business Intents. No OBCs.

**Question:** What Business Signals deserve attention in this product?

**Does not contain:** OBC. Commitment. Permanent identifier.

**Relationship with other concepts:** First level of the local flow. Business Signals advance via Premortem + Preliminary Risk Analysis + Owner Approval to the Product Backlog — at which point a new Business Intent entity is created. When risk triggers apply, the formal Reliability Plan is produced later during the Icebox. See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Product Backlog

**Definition:** Product-level backlog representing all work formally accepted by the Product Owner. Single entry point for the product into the Delivery cycle — regardless of where the item came from (Portfolio or local flow). Contains exclusively **Business Intents** — each Intent has a Local OBC as its contract document. Never contains Business Signals in isolation or Global OBCs.

**Question:** What has been officially accepted by the Product Owner?

**Two entry paths:** (1) Local OBC Draft from OBC Partitioning (global flow, born from a Business Intent); (2) Product Tracking Item via Premortem + Preliminary Risk Analysis + Owner Approval (local flow, creates Business Intent + Local OBC Draft upon entry).

**Three views of the Product Backlog:**
- **Icebox** — items in Discovery/Exploration (state: Refining)
- **Iteration Backlog** — items ready for Delivery (state: Committed)
- **Release** — items grouped by release version

**After entry, the origin no longer matters.** All items follow the same journey: Icebox → Iteration Backlog → Iteration Plan → Delivery.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Convergence point of the global and local flows. See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Icebox

**Definition:** A **view of the Product Backlog** representing items still being prepared for Delivery. The functional, technical, and operational Discovery needed occurs here. Goal: produce a Committed Local OBC ready for Delivery. Artifact: `prodops/artifacts/product/backlogs/icebox-backlog.md`.

**Nature:** View — not a separate queue. Items do not leave the Product Backlog when in this view.

**OBC state in this view:** Refining (items in active Discovery/Exploration)

**Question:** What is still being prepared for Delivery?

**Relationship with other concepts:** View over the Product Backlog. Items advance to the Iteration Backlog when Local OBC reaches Committed state. See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Iteration Backlog

**Definition:** A **view of the Product Backlog** representing items with a Committed Local OBC, ready for immediate Delivery. Not a refinement backlog — refinement happens in the Icebox. The only remaining decision is the Product Owner's priority. Artifact: `prodops/artifacts/product/backlogs/iteration-backlog.md`.

**Nature:** View — not a separate queue. Items do not leave the Product Backlog when in this view.

**OBC state in this view:** Committed (ready for Delivery — criteria validated and approved)

**Question:** What is ready to be developed?

**Relationship with other concepts:** View over the Product Backlog. Items appear here when the Local OBC reaches Committed state. Items advance to the Iteration Plan after Local OBC committed + BDD Feature committed. See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Release (view of Product Backlog)

**Definition:** Third view of the Product Backlog that groups items by release version (e.g., `v1.2.0`, `v2.0.0`). Allows the Product Owner to visualize which features will be part of each software release.

**Nature:** View — not a separate queue. Items do not leave the Product Backlog when associated with a release version.

**Purpose:** Provide a release-oriented view of committed work without creating a separate artifact. The items are the same as in the Icebox and Iteration Backlog — just grouped by release target.

**Relationship with other concepts:** One of the three Product Backlog views (Icebox, Iteration Backlog, Release). See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Iteration Plan

**Definition:** Record of Delivery execution for an iteration. Not a planning backlog — it represents exclusively the execution in progress. Contains items from the Iteration Backlog, execution strategy, CI Sync and CI Async journeys, evidence, and exit criteria. Artifact: `prodops/artifacts/plans/iteration-plan.md`.

**Question:** What is being executed in this iteration?

**Relationship with other concepts:** Receives items from the Iteration Backlog with OBC committed + BDD committed. It is the last backlog before Delivery. See [`backlogs.en.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## CI Sync

**Definition:** The synchronous Cycle of ProdOps Delivery. Represents local, collaborative work driven by the engineer. Includes Bootstrap, Hack, Sync, and Finish. Produces: closed task, PR with narrative, evidence, organized commits, local validations executed. See [`journeys/delivery/README.md`](journeys/delivery/README.en.md).

---

## CI Async

**Definition:** The asynchronous Cycle of ProdOps Delivery. Represents work driven by the platform, pipelines, and environments. Includes Ship, Validate, and Promote. Produces: published artifact, deploy completed, runtime validation, controlled promotion. See [`journeys/delivery/README.md`](journeys/delivery/README.en.md).

---

## Execution Model

**Definition:** The transversal framework that defines the commitment level, quality gates, and quality criteria applied when any Journey is executed. Composed of two Execution Modes: Upstream (exploration) and Downstream (commitment). Not a Journey, not a Phase.

**Fundamental rule:** The Execution Model defines *how* Journeys execute — not *what* they are. Any Journey can operate in either mode.

**Distinction:** _Execution Model_ is the framework; _Execution Mode_ is one of the two individual modes (Upstream or Downstream). "Execution mode" translates Execution Mode — not Execution Model.

→ Full definition: [`ontology.md — Execution Model`](ontology.md#cross-cutting-modifier-execution-model) · [`execution-model/README.en.md`](execution-model/README.en.md)

---

## Execution Mode

**Definition:** One of the two individual modes of the Execution Model — Upstream or Downstream. Defines the commitment level and quality gates applied to an item during its execution in any Journey.

**Distinction:** _Execution Mode_ is the individual mode; _Execution Model_ is the framework that defines and governs them. See: Upstream, Downstream.

---

## Journey

**Definition:** A work path with a single responsibility, its own lifecycle, and defined entry and exit criteria. The 5 journeys are: Discovery, Delivery, Operation, Assessment, and Diligence.

**Fundamental rule:** Journeys are not execution modes. Upstream and Downstream are not journeys — they are modes of the Execution Model that apply over journeys.

→ Full definition: [`ontology.en.md — Journey`](ontology.en.md#journey) · [`journeys/README.en.md`](journeys/README.en.md)

---

## Cycle

**Definition:** An ordered grouping of Phases within a Journey, with distinct purpose, trigger, and nature. Delivery has CI Sync and CI Async; Diligence has diligence-sync and diligence-async. Workspace Reconciliation is a **Capability** of Diligence — not a Cycle. Discovery, Operation, and Assessment have no formal Cycles.

→ Full definition: [`ontology.en.md — Cycle`](ontology.en.md#cycle)

---

## Phase

**Definition:** An individual, ordered stage within a Cycle, with entry preconditions, single responsibility, and verifiable exit postconditions. Examples: Bootstrap, Hack, Ship, Capture, Inspect.

**Distinction:** [`phases.en.md`](phases.en.md) describes **Conception** and **Inception** — these are **Lifecycle Stages** (stages of the Business Intent lifecycle before Delivery), conceptually distinct from the Phases in this ontology. When ambiguity exists, use the explicit qualifier: "Lifecycle Stage", "Delivery Phase", or "Diligence Phase".

→ Full definition: [`ontology.en.md — Phase`](ontology.en.md#phase)

---

## Skill

**Definition:** A specification of executable behavior intended for agents. A Skill implements a Journey, Cycle, Phase, or Capability, describing what the agent must do, when to enter, what to read, and what to produce. Skill is NOT a structural concept of the Framework — it is a technology-independent implementation.

→ Full definition: [`ontology.en.md — Skill`](ontology.en.md#skill) · [`skills/README.en.md`](../skills/README.en.md)

---

## Step

**Definition:** An ordered sub-unit within a Skill, with its own input and output. Can be invoked individually. Step is an internal structure of Skill — it has no direct relationship with the structural axis (Journey, Cycle, Phase, Capability).

→ Full definition: [`ontology.en.md — Step`](ontology.en.md#step)

---

## Bootstrap

**Definition:** The first stage of CI Sync. Installs dependencies, prepares local infrastructure, verifies configuration, and runs the smoke gate. Does not read code, tests, or product artifacts, and does not create a branch — Git flow belongs to Hack Start. See [`journeys/delivery/phases/bootstrap/README.en.md`](journeys/delivery/phases/bootstrap/README.en.md).

---

## Upstream

**Definition:** **Execution mode** — permissive, exploratory, with no delivery commitment. Objective: transform hypotheses into validated knowledge. Code is disposable until promoted to Downstream. Upstream selects flow steps as needed — there is no mandatory sequence. A typical Upstream cycle uses Bootstrap + Hack + Sync; Ship, Validate, and Promote are used only when the experiment needs staging validation or a promotion decision.

**Not a phase** — it is a mode that can start at **any stage** of the lifecycle (including during Delivery or Operation). When finished, the item returns to the original stage.

See [`prodops/framework/journeys/discovery/README.en.md`](journeys/discovery/README.en.md).

---

## Downstream

**Definition:** **Execution mode** — the default, with delivery commitment. Objective: deliver with confidence using validated knowledge. Every item requires OBC + BDD Feature + risks documented + entry in the Iteration Plan. A Reliability Plan is required when the canonical risk triggers apply. Downstream requires the full flow: `Bootstrap → Hack → Sync → Finish → Ship → Validate → Promote`.

**Not a phase** — it is an execution mode. Can start at any stage of the lifecycle.

See [`prodops/framework/execution-model/downstream.en.md`](execution-model/downstream.en.md).

---

## Hack

**Definition:** The coding phase in Upstream and Downstream. Second stage of CI Sync, follows Bootstrap. Defined in [`journeys/delivery/phases/hack/README.md`](journeys/delivery/phases/hack/README.en.md). Execution mechanics in [`skills/hack/`](../skills/hack/).

**Informal alias:** "Hack Flow" — do not use in canonical documentation; the correct term is "Hack" (Phase).

---

## Sync

**Definition:** The third stage of CI Sync. Has two independent steps: `rebase` (synchronizes the feature branch with the base — fetch, integration, conflicts, validation) and `align` (aligns ProdOps artifacts with the implementation — BDD Features, Event Storming, architecture, Release Trail). Invoked via `/sync rebase` and `/sync align`. See [`journeys/delivery/phases/sync/README.en.md`](journeys/delivery/phases/sync/README.en.md).

---

## Ship

**Definition:** The first stage of CI Async. Transforms the finalized implementation into an executable artifact and conducts the deploy. Organized in two families: Preparation (Build, Package, Version, Sign, SBOM, Publish Artifact) and Deployment (Deploy, Progressive Delivery, Feature Flags, Rollout, Rollback, Infrastructure Validation). Build, Package, and Publish are internal capabilities of Ship — they are not independent steps of the main flow. See phases: [Ship](journeys/delivery/phases/ship/README.en.md), [Validate](journeys/delivery/phases/validate/README.en.md), [Promote](journeys/delivery/phases/promote/README.en.md).

---

## Validate

**Definition:** The second stage of CI Async. Verifies the delivery running in the target environment. Capabilities: Smoke Tests, Runtime Contract Validation, Synthetic Monitoring, Health Checks, Observability Validation, SLO Validation, Business Validation, Incident Signals. See phases: [Ship](journeys/delivery/phases/ship/README.en.md), [Validate](journeys/delivery/phases/validate/README.en.md), [Promote](journeys/delivery/phases/promote/README.en.md).

---

## Promote

**Definition:** The third stage of CI Async. Officially advances the version with formal approval and recorded evidence. Capabilities: Promotion Gates, Environment Promotion, Release Approval, Release Trail, Operational Evidence, Release Documentation, Rollback Readiness. See phases: [Ship](journeys/delivery/phases/ship/README.en.md), [Validate](journeys/delivery/phases/validate/README.en.md), [Promote](journeys/delivery/phases/promote/README.en.md).

---

## ProdOps TDD

**Definition:** The practice used within the Hack Flow to produce observable and reliable code. Defined in [`journeys/delivery/practices/prodops-tdd.md`](journeys/delivery/practices/prodops-tdd.en.md).

---

## Red Bar

**Definition:** A failing test that correctly expresses the desired behavior. Confirms that the test detects the missing implementation.

---

## Green Bar

**Definition:** A passing test after the minimum implementation is in place.

---

## Yellow Bar

**Definition:** Patterns used to manage difficult test scenarios: child tests, crash dummies, log strings. Not a license to mock business logic.

---

## Progressive Substitution

**Definition:** Testing strategy where a Mock Server (contract-based) is used first, then replaced by the real integration without rewriting the tests. The tests verify behavior through the same contract surface regardless of what is behind it.

---

## Mock Server

**Definition:** Infrastructure-level test double that simulates an external dependency based on a contract (e.g.: WireMock, Prism). Distinct from Mock Object, which replaces an own service.

---

## Mock Object

**Definition:** Test double for a technical dependency (logger, clock, UUID generator, telemetry adapter). Acceptable only when it does not hide business behavior.

---

## Product Deck

**Definition:** A single-page canvas that aggregates the essential information about a digital product — Product Vision, Product Services (with SLOs and lead-time), Product Team, Execution Architecture, Reliability Matrix, Product Analytics, and Stakeholders. A living artifact, continuously updated across the Operation, Delivery, and Assessment journeys.

**Purpose:** Allow any team member, stakeholder, or external collaborator to understand the product — its value, operational state, and risks — without consulting additional documentation. Inspired by Toyota's A3 Report and Shopify's Resilience Matrix.

**When to use:** Premortems, maturity Assessments, onboarding of new members, roadmap reviews, incidents that require architecture and dependency context.

**When not to use:** The Product Deck does not replace the Local OBC (which defines the observable contract for each capability), the Reliability Plan (which details risk analysis), or the Release Trail (which records delivery evidence). Each of these artifacts is a source of input for the Product Deck — not the other way around.

**Location:** `prodops/artifacts/product/product-deck.md` (one per product).

**Relationship with other concepts:** Consumes `local-obc` (SLOs), `reliability-plan` (Reliability Matrix), `release-trail` (Product Analytics). Consumed by premortems (Execution Architecture), Assessment, and Bootstrap.

→ **Full definition with canonical sections and lifecycle:** [`product-deck.en.md`](product-deck.en.md)

---

## Service Deck

**Definition:** A single-page canvas that represents a service as a product — the same seven sections as the Product Deck, but with the service as the central unit of analysis. Each entry in a Product Deck's Product Services section references exactly one Service Deck.

**Two types of Product Service:** `Service` (single deployable unit with its own responsibility and SLO) or `Value Stream` (logical grouping of one or more Services that together deliver a specific business outcome).

**Link to Data:** the Service Deck corresponds to exactly one Local OBC. The Service Endpoints section of the Service Deck surfaces the OBC's contracts — APIs, events, schemas, SLIs — making the **Data dimension** visible at the service's operational level. The OBC is the source of truth; the Service Deck is the consolidated reading point.

**When to use:** when a service is listed in the Product Deck with a committed Local OBC. A service without a committed OBC must not have a Service Deck — it must be flagged as pending an observable contract.

**Location:** `prodops/artifacts/services/<service-slug>/service-deck.md`.

**Relationship with other concepts:** referenced by the Product Deck (Product Services); consumes `local-obc` (Service Endpoints), `reliability-plan` (Service Reliability), and `release-trail` (Service Analytics); feeds the Product Deck's Reliability Matrix.

→ **Full definition with canonical sections and lifecycle:** [`service-deck.en.md`](service-deck.en.md)

---

## Decision Trail

**Definition:** Record of a decision made under uncertainty, including context, alternatives, and impact. Template: [`prodops/templates/assessment/decision-trail.md`](../templates/assessment/decision-trail.en.md).

---

## Release Trail

**Definition:** The append-only log of Downstream evidence. Each agent session produces its own file at `prodops/artifacts/trails/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<session-id>.md`. See model at `prodops/artifacts/trails/release-trail.md`.

---

## Assessment

**Definition:** Journey of the ProdOps Framework responsible for evaluating the operational model over time. Consumes evidence produced by Delivery and Diligence to assess maturity, identify trends, and produce evolution recommendations.

**Purpose:** Close the continuous improvement cycle of the Framework. While Delivery executes and Diligence organizes, Assessment evaluates — answering the central question: "Are we continuously improving our operational model?"

**Cycles:** Assessment Sync (Collect → Analyze → Synthesize → Report — structured, on demand) and Assessment Async (Monitor → Alert — continuous, proactive).

**What it does not do:** Does not execute Delivery. Does not execute Diligence. Does not write to other Journeys' Timelines. Does not prioritize the backlog — it informs, it does not decide.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Consumes outputs from Delivery and Diligence; its recommendations feed Discovery and Diligence. See [`journeys/assessment/README.en.md`](journeys/assessment/README.en.md).

---

## Diligence

**Definition:** Cross-cutting journey of the ProdOps Framework responsible for keeping the work system synchronized and consistent throughout the product lifecycle.

**Purpose:** Close the gap between decisions produced by Assessment and work ready for Delivery. Ensure that the state of each OBC remains synchronized across all backlogs, tools, and management artifacts.

**Principle:** Diligence is the guardian of consistency of the ProdOps work system. It ensures that the state of each Observable Business Contract remains synchronized across all backlogs, tools, and management artifacts, without modifying product code.

**When to use:** Continuously. Diligence has no start and end per cycle — it accompanies the product for as long as it exists. It is activated by new risks, incidents, postmortems, strategic changes, or divergences detected between artifacts.

**What it does not do:** Does not implement software. Does not create implementation Pull Requests. Does not modify product code. Does not make product decisions that belong to Assessment.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Cross-cutting journey. Consumes Assessment recommendations and feeds Delivery with organized, traceable work. In turn, it produces execution and synchronization evidence that Assessment consumes to evaluate operational maturity — the relationship is bidirectional. See [`journeys/diligence/README.md`](journeys/diligence/README.en.md) and [`backlogs.md`](backlogs.en.md).

---

## Canonical Operational Representation

**Definition:** The operational materialization of the ProdOps conceptual model.

In the current stage of the Framework, the Canonical Operational Representation is realized through **GitHub Projects** (scoped by Journey or operational domain) and **GitHub Issues** (individual Work Items).

**What it is NOT:** The Canonical Operational Representation is not the conceptual model itself. OBCs, Business Intents, Business Signals, and other artifacts continue to live as Markdown files in `prodops/`. GitHub is the operational expression of that knowledge — not the knowledge itself.

**Maintenance responsibility:** The **Diligence** journey is the guardian of synchronization between the conceptual model (`prodops/`) and the Canonical Operational Representation (GitHub Projects and Issues).

**Relationship with other concepts:** See [GitHub Project](#github-project), [GitHub Issue](#github-issue), [knowledge-vs-execution.en.md](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md).

---

## GitHub Project

**Definition:** The canonical operational representation of a Journey or operational domain of ProdOps. Organizes and projects Work Items (GitHub Issues) of a specific scope (by Journey, Phase, and Operation). Does not represent the Framework as a whole — the Framework can have multiple canonical Projects, each covering the scope of its Journey. Does not replace Knowledge Space artifacts.

**Purpose:** Make visible the work in progress on ProdOps artifacts, grouped and filtered by operational dimensions (Journey, Artifact Type, Operation, Phase).

**What it represents:** A work management domain. Each GitHub Project tracks Work Items of a scope (Portfolio or Product Repository). Does not contain artifacts — contains operations over artifacts.

**What it does NOT represent:** Artifact backlogs. The GitHub Project is not a substitute for OBCs, Business Intents, Business Signals, or any Knowledge Space artifact. Views within a Project are filters over Work Items — never over artifacts.

**Canonical status:** GitHub Projects constitute the Canonical Operational Representation of ProdOps — each Project operationally represents a specific Journey or operational domain. There is no abstraction to other tools (Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear). External tools are optional synchronizations — never equivalents.

→ See [Canonical Operational Representation](#canonical-operational-representation)

**Relationship with other concepts:** Contains Work Items (GitHub Issues). Organized by Views. State represented by Fields. Classified by Labels. See [knowledge-vs-execution.en.md](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md).

---

## View (GitHub Project)

**Definition:** Canonical projection of the state of Work Items (GitHub Issues) within a GitHub Project, filtered and organized by a specific operational dimension — Journey, Phase, Operation, Artifact Type, or a combination of them.

**Purpose:** Make visible the relevant operational slices of work in progress — e.g., "all Work Items of the Delivery journey in Hack phase" or "Work Items blocked by Findings".

**What it represents:** A persistent, named filter over Work Items. The View does not alter Work Item state — it only projects them. Different Views can show the same Work Items from different perspectives.

**What it does NOT represent:** A list of artifacts. "The Icebox View" shows Work Items about artifacts in Refining state — not the artifacts themselves. The absence of an artifact in a View does not mean the artifact is absent from the system.

**Distinction:** View in the sense of this entry is the GitHub Projects interface construct. Do not confuse with conceptual backlog views (Icebox, Iteration Backlog, Release) — those are ProdOps model constructs that can be *implemented* as GitHub Project Views.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Derived from Fields. Part of a GitHub Project. See [knowledge-vs-execution.en.md](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md).

---

## Field (GitHub Project)

**Definition:** Operational state of a Work Item (GitHub Issue) within a GitHub Project. Fields represent the operational state dimensions needed to correctly project each Work Item in Views.

**Canonical required fields:** `Artifact Type`, `Artifact ID`, `Operation`, `Journey`. See full schema at [`execution-mapping/work-item-schema.md`](execution-mapping/work-item-schema.md).

**Two types of fields:**
- **Fields owned by the Execution Space** (GitHub): `Status`, `Assignee`, `Priority` — can be edited directly in the Project.
- **Fields owned by the Knowledge Space** (Markdown artifacts): `Artifact ID`, `Artifact Type`, `Finding Severity`, `Waiver Expiration` — must not be edited manually in the Project; manual edits create drift.

**What they are NOT:** Source of truth for artifacts. The canonical state of an artifact lives in its Markdown file. Fields that derive from the Knowledge Space are reflections — not sources of truth.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Filled by the Work Item creator (identity fields) or by GitHub (operational fields). Read by Views. Audited by Diligence (Capability: Workspace Reconciliation). See [execution-mapping/work-item-schema.md](execution-mapping/work-item-schema.md).

---

## Label (GitHub)

**Definition:** Auxiliary classification mechanism for Work Items (GitHub Issues) — **never** a source of truth for the state of any ProdOps artifact or entity.

**Purpose:** Facilitate search, filtering, and operational categorization of Work Items by `operation:<value>` and `artifact-type:<value>`.

**Canonical usage in ProdOps:**
- `operation:<value>` — operation being executed (e.g.: `operation:refine`, `operation:promote`)
- `artifact-type:<value>` — type of the affected artifact (e.g.: `artifact-type:local-obc`, `artifact-type:finding`)
- `journey:<value>` — ProdOps journey (recommended)

**What Labels CANNOT represent:**
- Canonical ID of any entity (Finding, Remediation, Waiver, OBC, etc.)
- Canonical status of a Finding or any artifact
- Finding severity
- Waiver approval
- Waiver expiration state
- Any state that requires persistence and auditability

**Rule:** If the information needs to be permanent, auditable, or authoritative, it belongs in the entity's Markdown file — not in a Label. Labels are ephemeral and mutable; canonical states are not.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Used in GitHub Issues. Naming convention defined in [execution-mapping/work-item-schema.md](execution-mapping/work-item-schema.md). See [knowledge-vs-execution.en.md](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md).

---

## GitHub Issue

**Definition:** Work Item representing an operation being executed on one or more Knowledge Space artifacts (Business Signal, Business Intent, OBC, BDD, etc.).

**Purpose:** Make the execution work performed on ProdOps artifacts visible and traceable in GitHub Projects.

**When to use:** When recording work (exploration, refinement, delivery, review) on any Knowledge Space artifact. A Work Item must always reference the affected artifact(s) by type and ID.

**When not to use:** Do not create GitHub Issues to bypass the entity model. The OBC is a Markdown document — it does not have an Issue representation.

**GitHub as primary operational source:** GitHub Projects are the canonical management domains. GitHub Project Views are projections over those domains. Jira, Azure DevOps, and Linear are optional sync tools only — they never replace GitHub as the source of truth for work state.

**Work Items reference artifacts — they are not the artifacts.**

Every Work Item must declare: Artifact Type, Artifact ID, Operation, Journey.

Examples of correct Work Items:
- Issue: "Discovery — BI-042 Split payment support" → references Business Intent BI-042
- Issue: "Refine OBC payments-invoice-v2 — incomplete BDD section" → references Local OBC
- Issue: "Update architecture — new webhooks module" → references Architecture overview.md

A single artifact can have dozens of Work Items throughout its life.
A single Work Item can affect multiple artifacts.

**Relationship with other concepts:** Managed by Diligence. See [`backlogs.md`](backlogs.en.md) and [`journeys/diligence/README.md`](journeys/diligence/README.en.md).

→ [Knowledge vs Execution](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md)

---

## Business Signal Work Item

**Definition:** Work Item (GitHub Issue) tracking an active operation over a Business Signal. Represents work ABOUT the Signal — it is not the Signal itself. The Signal is a Knowledge Space artifact (file in the tracking list); the Work Item is an ephemeral representation of execution work.

**Example operations:** capture, triage, exploration, promotion to Business Intent.

**Cardinality:** A Business Signal can have zero or more Work Items across its lifetime. The absence of a Work Item is not a divergence — it only is a divergence when there is an active operation without a traceable Work Item.

**Do not confuse with:** The Business Signal itself (permanent artifact). See [knowledge-vs-execution.en.md](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md).

---

## Business Intent Work Item

**Definition:** Work Item (GitHub Issue) tracking an active operation over a Business Intent. Represents work ABOUT the Intent — it is not the Intent itself. The Intent is a Knowledge Space artifact; the Work Item is an ephemeral representation of execution work.

**Example operations:** exploration, refinement, review, promotion, partitioning.

**Cardinality:** A Business Intent can have zero or more Work Items across its lifetime. The absence of a Work Item is not a divergence — it only is a divergence when there is an active operation without a traceable Work Item.

**Do not confuse with:** The Business Intent itself (permanent artifact). The OBC is a Markdown document — it does not have an Issue representation. See [knowledge-vs-execution.en.md](knowledge-vs-execution.en.md).
