# HACK Workflow

HACK is the implementation phase. The agent repeats the work engineers did manually: branch, focused reading, TDD, code, lint, validation, commit.

## Branch

- Start from a clean understanding of the current branch and worktree.
- If there are unrelated dirty files, leave them untouched and mention them.
- If the user did not provide a branch name, create one from the task:
  - Feature: `feat/<short-slug>`
  - Fix: `fix/<short-slug>`
  - Chore: `chore/<short-slug>`
- Prefer `git switch -c <branch>` for new branches.
- Do not use `git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- <file>`, or destructive cleanup.

## Implementation

- Read focused code before editing. Start with the module being changed, its tests, and the direct imports needed to understand the change.
- Do not read the entire codebase by default. Expand only when the behavior crosses module boundaries or the focused context is insufficient.
- Follow existing module boundaries, naming, DTOs, env vars, and scripts.
- Prefer small changes that preserve current architecture.
- Add abstractions only when they remove real duplication or match an existing local pattern.
- Execute a Product Skill declarada pelo produto em `prodops/skills/local/` (quando existir) para padrões específicos do repositório antes de alterar comportamento de pagamento.

## Code Style — Active Lint Rules

The `api/` package enforces these rules via `eslint.config.mjs`. Write code that satisfies them from the start; do not leave formatting to a post-edit fix pass.

**Prettier** (auto-fixable — enforced via `eslint-plugin-prettier`):
- Single quotes for strings.
- Trailing commas in multi-line arrays, objects, and parameter lists.
- No semicolons at end of statements (the project uses them — do not remove).
- 2-space indentation.
- Max line width: 100 characters. Break long argument lists and object literals across lines.
- Opening brace on same line (`if (x) {`); closing brace on its own line.

**TypeScript strict** (`tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked`):
- No `any` explicit type (rule is off, but avoid it anyway — use `unknown` or a concrete type).
- No floating promises: every `async` call that returns a promise must be `await`ed or explicitly `void`-cast.
- No unsafe argument: do not pass `any`-typed values to typed parameters.
- Unused variables and imports cause lint errors — remove them immediately.

**Practical rule:** after writing a file, mentally apply Prettier line-break rules before saving. Multi-line object literals need a trailing comma on the last property. Import lists with 3+ items should be multi-line.

## Clean Code

See [`references/local/engineering/clean-code/`](../../references/local/engineering/clean-code/README.md) for the full reference _(product-local reference)_.

Key operational rule for this repo: avoid drive-by cleanup, speculative refactors, and broad formatting churn. Refactor only in the Yellow phase, only under green tests.

## TDD Cycle

See [`references/engineering/tdd-prodops/red-green-refactor.md`](../../references/engineering/tdd-prodops/red-green-refactor.md) for the full cycle with allowed/prohibited actions per phase.

Required evidence before committing:

- The test file and scenario added or changed.
- The failing command and failure reason from the red phase.
- The passing command from the green/refactor phase.

Do not skip the red phase unless the task is documentation-only, mechanical cleanup, dependency maintenance, or an explicitly untestable operational change. If skipped, record why.

## No Mocks Rule

> **Definição técnica do No Mocks Rule.** Para o gate de enforcement (o que bloqueia merge), ver [`quality-gates.md`](../../../framework/journeys/delivery/phases/finish/quality-gates.md). Para os Yellow Bar patterns aceitáveis, ver [`mocking-policy.md`](../../references/engineering/tdd-prodops/mocking-policy.md).

**Acceptance and integration tests never use test doubles.** This is an unconditional rule.

Prohibited in `api/test/`:

- `jest.fn()` as a service replacement
- `jest.spyOn(...).mockImplementation()`, `.mockReturnValue()`, `.mockResolvedValue()`, `.mockRejectedValue()` and all `mockXxx` variants
- `.overrideProvider()` in `Test.createTestingModule()`
- Any class, object, or function that replaces a real owned service with a test-controlled substitute

**Designed behavior modes are not mocks.** When the product defines a provider mode (e.g., `<PROVIDER>_MOCK=true`), the real service is instantiated and runs; it returns deterministic data via an internal branch rather than making external HTTP calls. This is acceptable because it exercises the real code path. Each product declares its own provider mode variable.

**Error paths that require external system failure** (provider timeout, provider returning malformed data, network errors) are not covered by acceptance tests. Those scenarios belong in focused unit or service-layer tests that can use test doubles because they test a single unit in isolation. Acceptance tests cover the contract visible at the HTTP boundary using only the real system.

**Shared app per file.** Each acceptance test file creates the application under test once in `beforeAll` and tears it down in `afterAll`. Tables are truncated in `beforeEach`. Recreating the app per test is prohibited — it bypasses shared state that the real system maintains and makes test runs artificially expensive.

## Tests and Validation

- Add or update tests close to the touched behavior.
- Use existing test frameworks and scripts.
- Run the narrowest meaningful test first.
- Run broad validation before committing when shared behavior, contracts, or build config changed.

**Lint is mandatory after every code change in `api/`.** Run it with `--fix` so Prettier and auto-fixable ESLint violations are corrected in place. TypeScript type errors are not auto-fixable — they must be resolved in the source.

```sh
# Inside api/
npm run lint        # runs eslint "{src,apps,libs,test}/**/*.ts" --fix
```

Run lint:
1. After implementing the green phase.
2. After refactoring.
3. Before committing — always.

If lint exits non-zero after `--fix`, read the remaining errors, fix them in the source, and re-run until clean.

In `validation-workbench/`, no lint script exists; run `npm run build` for TypeScript and Vite validation.

## Commit

Before committing:

```sh
git diff --check
git status --short
git diff --stat
```

Stage only files that belong to the task:

```sh
git add <paths>
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached --check
```

Commit:

```sh
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <concise summary>"
```

After committing:

```sh
git status --short
git rev-parse --short HEAD
```
